  ## Description

  My motivation for this project was - To delve deeper into using Node.JS to organize projects into separate specialized files/modules.
  I build this project because - It is a simple example to understanding why projects may be easier to comprehend when broken down into multiple files.
  The problem this project solves is - Super wordy/lengthy code that is difficult to navigate in one index.js
  Developing this project I learned - How to import/export files with JavaScript, and that I can create a program that interacts with the user without ever needing to put it into a webpage.

  ## Installation
